# ChemCam

This is an Augmented Reality based project which scans simple target images in the form of plain text written on pieces of paper and makes use of a varied library of 3D models to play an augmented overlay on top of the targets. This can help beginners in chemistry to visualise different types of bonds, lattices, molecules and orbitals.
Unity has been used create the necessary scenes and with the aid of Vuforia engine the AR experience has been crafted. The buttons interactivity has been done with the help of small C# snippets. 
There are about 5 individual scenes:
* The main page
* Atoms and molecules page
* Bonds page
* Orbitals page 
* Lattices page

### The main page

### The lattices page

Every scene except the main page has a back button for ease of navigation.
I designed the 3D assets using Microsoft Paint 3D.
